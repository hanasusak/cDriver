Description: The cDriver package provides several functions to calculate the cancer cell fraction 
    of somatic mutations and to rank genes based on a Bayesian inference model. The input file 
    is a tab separated column file similar to MAF files provided by TCGA. The user needs 
    to provide silent and nonsilent mutations detected in coding regions. Also, the R package 
    provides functions to estimate an FDR that allows the use to select the best number 
    of candidate driver genes. If user cant provide optional columns, the function will 
    use a pre-calculated default value.
