Description: Package has several functions to help you calculate Cancer Cell
    Fraction and rank genes based on posterior probability calculated with
    Bayes inference models. Functions works with MAF like files, but some
    differences exist (additional columns). User need to provide silent and non
    silent mutations detected in exotic and splicing regions. Also some
    functions recomand list of genes which were covered by probes and length
    covered by sequencing of these genes. In case user can not provide optional
    columns/info, function will replace variables with most likely/plausible
    values.
